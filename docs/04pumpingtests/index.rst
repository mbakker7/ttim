Pumping tests
=============

This series of benchmark problems demonstrate the features and capabilities of TTim for
simulating and analyzing transient groundwater hydraulic problems such as pumping tests
and slug tests.


Synthetic
---------

1. `Synthetic pumping test`_ - a synthetic pumping test

Confined Pumping Tests
----------------------

1. `Oude Korendijk`_ - One layer confined pumping test with two observation wells
2. `Grindley`_ - One layer confined pumping test with data from both observation well and pumping well.
3. `Sioux`_ - One Layer confined aquifer test with three observation wells
4. `Schroth`_ - Three layers (Aquifer - Aquitard - Aquifer) confined pumping test with one observation well.
5. `Nevada`_ - One layer, fractured confined aquifer test with data from both observation well and pumping well.

Leaky Pumping Tests (Semi-confined)
-----------------------------------


1. `Dalem`_ - One layer, semi-confined aquifer test with four observation wells.
2. `Hardixveld`_ - Four layers (Aquitard - Aquifer - Aquitard - Aquifer) semi-confined pumping test with data from the pumping well.
3. `Texas Hill`_ - One layer, semi-confined aquifer test with three observation wells.

Unconfined Pumping Tests
------------------------

1. `Vennebulten`_ - Two layers, unconfined aquifer test with data two observation wells screened at different depths.
2. `Moench`_ - Solving the Analytical model from Moench in TTim. Pumping test in unconfined aquifer with four piezometers screened at two different depths and two different distances

Slug Tests
----------

1. `Pratt County`_ - One layer partially penetrated slug test with data from the test well.
2. `Falling Head`_ - One layer partially penetrated slug test with data from the test well.
3. `Multi-Well`_ - One layer confined slug test with data from the test well and from an observation well.
4. `Dawsonville`_ - One layer fully-penetrated confined slug test with data from the test well.
