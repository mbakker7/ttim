    "Pathlines are computed through numerical integration of the velocity vector. Pathlines are computed with the `timtrace` function. The `timtrace` function takes as input arguments the starting locations of the pathline (`xstart`, `ystart`, `zstart`), a list with the starting time and end time of the pathline (`tstartend`), a time offset (`tstartoffset`), and a maximum time step (`tstep`). The pathline starts at the starting time plus the time offset (`tstartoffset`). When the starting time is at the time of a change in boundary condition (e.g., a well starts pumping), the time offset can not be smaller than `tmin`. The `timtrace` function has several keyword arguments to affect the numerical integration procedure. The `hstepmax` keyword is used here, which is the maximum horizontal step (in the length units consistently used throughout the model). \n",

    "- `'status'` : numerical indication of the result. Negative is likely undesirable.\n",

Numerical integration stops when the maximum number of steps is reached and the returned `status` is `-2`. For most practical cases, this is an undesirable result and the maximum number of steps should be increased. Setting `silent=True` prevents the message from being printed to the screen, which may be useful when a lot of pathlines are computed, for example in a loop. When the `correctionstep` is set to `True` (default), the numerical integration scheme is a predictor-correcter scheme. When `correctionstep` is set to `False`, the integration scheme is forward integration through time, which is less accurate but quicker. "
